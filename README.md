# VO-SemRep
VO-SemRep: To apply SemRep and VO to process PubMed papers for vaccine related information.

[SemRep](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/ii/tools/SemRep_SemMedDB_SKR/SemRep.html) is a UMLS-based program that extracts semantic predications (Subject-Predicate-Object) from sentences in biomedical text. Since the Vaccine Ontology (VO) is not in UMLS for now, we cannot us the default SemRep to process PubMed papers. 

This project aims to customize SemRep to make it able to use VO to process vaccine-related biomedical literature, esp. PubMed literature. 

This is a project initiated in the University of Michigan.
